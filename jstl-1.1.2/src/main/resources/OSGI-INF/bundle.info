    The JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL) encapsulates as simple tags the core functionality common to many
    Web applications. JSTL has support for common, structural tasks such as iteration and conditionals, tags for
    manipulating XML documents, internationalization tags, and SQL tags. It also provides a framework for integrating
    existing custom tags with JSTL tags.

    The JSTL 1.2 Maintenance Release aligns with the Unified Expression Language (EL) that is being delivered as part
    of the JavaServer Pages (JSP) 2.1 specification. Thanks to the Unified EL, JSTL tags, such as the JSTL iteration
    tags, can now be used with JavaServer Faces components in an intuitive way.

    JSTL 1.2 is part of the Java EE 5 platform.
