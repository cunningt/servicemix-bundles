\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    Casbah is a Scala toolkit for MongoDB---We use the term "toolkit" rather than "driver", as Casbah integrates a layer on top of the official mongo-java-driver for better integration with Scala.  This is as opposed to a native implementation of the MongoDB wire protocol, which the Java driver does exceptionally well. Rather than a complete rewrite, Casbah uses implicits, and `Pimp My Library` code to enhance the existing Java code.
