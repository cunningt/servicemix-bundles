    XMLBeans is a technology for accessing XML by binding it to Java types.
    XMLBeans provides several ways to get at the XML, including:

        * Through XML schema that has been compiled to generate Java types that
          represent schema types. In this way, you can access instances of the
          schema through JavaBeans-style accessors after the fashion of "getFoo"
          and "setFoo".
          The XMLBeans API also allows you to reflect into the XML schema itself
          through an XML Schema Object model.
        * A cursor model through which you can traverse the full XML infoset.
        * Support for XML DOM.
