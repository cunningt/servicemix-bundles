    The OWASP AntiSamy project is a few things. Technically, it is an API for ensuring user-supplied HTML/CSS is in
    compliance within an application's rules. Another way of saying that could be: It's an API that helps you make
    sure that clients don't supply malicious cargo code in the HTML they supply for their profile, comments, etc.,
    that get persisted on the server. The term "malicious code" in regards to web applications usually mean
    "JavaScript." Cascading Stylesheets are only considered malicious when they invoke the JavaScript engine. However,
    there are many situations where "normal" HTML and CSS can be used in a malicious manner. So we take care of that
    too.

    Philosophically, AntiSamy is a departure from contemporary security mechanisms. Generally, the security mechanism
    and user have a communication that is virtually one way, for good reason. Letting the potential attacker know
    details about the validation is considered unwise as it allows the attacker to "learn" and "recon" the mechanism
    for weaknesses. These types of information leaks can also hurt in ways you don't expect. A login mechanism that
    tells the user, "Username invalid" leaks the fact that a user by that name does not exist. A user could use a
    dictionary or phone book or both to remotely come up with a list of valid usernames. Using this information, an
    attacker could launch a brute force attack or massive account lock denial-of-service. We get that.

    Unfortunately, that's just not very usable in this situation. Typical Internet users are largely pretty bad when it
    comes to writing HTML/CSS, so where do they get their HTML from? Usually they copy it from somewhere out on the web.
    Simply rejecting their input without any clue as to why is jolting and annoying. Annoyed users go somewhere else to
    do their social networking.
