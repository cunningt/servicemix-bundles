\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    The Apache™ Hadoop™ project develops open-source software for reliable, scalable, distributed computing.

    The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets
    across clusters of computers using a simple programming model. It is designed to scale up from single servers
    to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver
    high-avaiability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so
    delivering a highly-availabile service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to failures.
