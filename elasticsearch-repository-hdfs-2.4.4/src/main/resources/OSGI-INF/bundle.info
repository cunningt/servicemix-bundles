\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    So, we build a web site or an application and want to add search to it, and
    then it hits us: getting search working is hard. We want our search solution
    to be fast, we want a painless setup and a completely free search schema, we
    want to be able to index data simply using JSON over HTTP, we want our search
    server to be always available, we want to be able to start with one machine
    and scale to hundreds, we want real-time search, we want simple multi-tenancy,
    and we want a solution that is built for the cloud.
