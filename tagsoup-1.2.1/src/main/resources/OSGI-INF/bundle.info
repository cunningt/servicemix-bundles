\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    TagSoup, a SAX-compliant parser written in Java that, instead of parsing well-formed or valid XML, parses HTML as
    it is found in the wild: poor, nasty and brutish, though quite often far from short. TagSoup is designed for people
    who have to process this stuff using some semblance of a rational application design. By providing a SAX interface,
    it allows standard XML tools to be applied to even the worst HTML. TagSoup also includes a command-line processor
    that reads HTML files and can generate either clean HTML or well-formed XML that is a close approximation to XHTML.
