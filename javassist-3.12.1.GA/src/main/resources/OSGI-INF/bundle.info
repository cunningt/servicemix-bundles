\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
	Javassist (Java Programming Assistant) makes Java bytecode manipulation
	simple. It is a class library for editing bytecodes in Java; it enables
	Java programs to define a new class at runtime and to modify a class file
	when the JVM loads it. Unlike other similar bytecode editors, Javassist
	provides two levels of API: source level and bytecode level. If the users
	use the source-level API, they can edit a class file without knowledge of
	the specifications of the Java bytecode. The whole API is designed with only
	the vocabulary of the Java language. You can even specify inserted bytecode
	in the form of source text; Javassist compiles it on the fly. On the other
	hand, the bytecode-level API allows the users to directly edit a class file
	as other editors.

    Aspect Oriented Programming: Javassist can be a good tool for adding new
    methods into a class and for inserting before/after/around advice at the
    both caller and callee sides.

    Reflection: One of applications of Javassist is runtime reflection; Javassist
    enables Java programs to use a metaobject that controls method calls on
    base-level objects. No specialized compiler or virtual machine are needed.
