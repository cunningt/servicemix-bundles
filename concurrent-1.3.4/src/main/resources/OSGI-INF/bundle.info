\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    This package provides standardized, efficient versions of utility classes commonly
    encountered in concurrent Java programming. This code consists of implementations of
    ideas that have been around for ages, and is merely intended to save you the trouble
    of coding them. Discussions of the rationale and applications of several of these
    classes can be found in the second edition of Concurrent Programming in Java. There
    are also pdf slides providing an overview of the package.

    The package mainly consists of implementations of a few interfaces:

        Sync -- locks, conditions
        Channel -- queues, buffers
        Barrier -- multi-party synchronization
        SynchronizedVariable -- atomic ints, refs etc
        java.util.Collection -- collections
        Executor -- replacements for direct use of Thread

    Plus some utilities and frameworks that build upon these.
