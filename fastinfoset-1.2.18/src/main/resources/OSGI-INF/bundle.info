\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    The Fast Infoset standard draft (currently being developed as joint work by ISO/IEC JTC 1 and ITU-T)
    specifies a binary format for XML infosets that is an efficient alternative to XML. An instance of this
    binary format is called a fast infoset document. Fast infoset documents are analogous to XML documents.
    Each has a physical form and an XML infoset. Fast infoset documents are, given the results presented, faster
    to serialize and parse, and smaller in size, than the equivalent XML documents. Thus, fast infoset documents
    may be used whenever the size and processing time of XML documents is an issue.

    The binary format is optimized to balance the needs of both document size and processing time. Fast infoset
    documents are useful in a number of domains from bandwidth- and resource-constrained mobile devices to
    high-bandwidth high-throughput systems. In general, smaller documents are possible at the expense of either
    increased processing or loss of self-description and dependence on a schema. Faster processing is possible
    at the expense of loss of self-description and dependence on a schema. For example, standard compression
    (LZH) or XML-specific compression techniques (XMill) may be applied to XML documents to obtain smaller
    document sizes, but this adds to the processing time, especially in the compression phase, and can affect
    server-side performance.
