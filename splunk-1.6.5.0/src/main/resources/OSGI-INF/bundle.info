\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    This SDK contains library code and examples designed to enable developers to build applications using Splunk.
    With the Splunk SDK for Java you can write Java applications to programmatically interact with the Splunk engine.
    The SDK is built on top of the REST API, providing a wrapper over the REST API endpoints. So with fewer lines of
    code, you can write applications that:

        * Search your data, run saved searches, and work with search jobs.
        * Manage Splunk configurations and objects.
        * Integrate search results into your applications.
        * Log directly to Splunk.
        * Present a custom UI.
