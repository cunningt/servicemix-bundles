     JUNG â€” the Java Universal Network/Graph Framework--is a software library that provides a common and extendible language
     for the modeling, analysis, and visualization of data that can be represented as a graph or network. It is written
     in Java, which allows JUNG-based applications to make use of the extensive built-in capabilities of the Java API, as
      well as those of other existing third-party Java libraries.
