    This project publishes the Reference Implementation, Technology Compatibility
    Kit, examples and tools for JAIN-SIP-1.2 (JSR-32 maintenance release) and an
    SDP library that conforms to the public release of JSR 141 (JAIN-SDP) interfaces. JAIN-SIP is a low level Java API speicification for SIP Signaling. The intended users of this project are SIP developers.

    This project publishes a full implementation of the RFC 3261 Specification
    and as well as suppport for several SIP RFCs.

    You can embed the JAIN-SIP stack in an applet, HTTP servlet or an application.
    JAIN-SIP can be used in SIP Proxy Servers (stateful and statelss) and in SIP
    User Agents. JAIN-SIP has been used to build a Session Border Controller, a
    few Softphones, a Resource Adapter for the JAVA Service Logic Execution
    Environment, a SIP Servlet Implementation and in a few Test tools.

    The JAIN-SIP Reference implementation is a product of the Advanced Networking
    Technologies Division at the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST). The JAIN SIP RI, TCK and tools published by this project are in the
    public domain.
