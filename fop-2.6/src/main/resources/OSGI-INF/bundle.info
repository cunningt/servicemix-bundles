    Apache FOP (Formatting Objects Processor) is a print formatter driven by XSL formatting objects (XSL-FO) and an
    output independent formatter. It is a Java application that reads a formatting object (FO) tree and renders the
    resulting pages to a specified output. Output formats currently supported include PDF, PS, PCL, AFP,
    XML (area tree representation), Print, AWT and PNG, and to a lesser extent, RTF and TXT.
    The primary output target is PDF.
