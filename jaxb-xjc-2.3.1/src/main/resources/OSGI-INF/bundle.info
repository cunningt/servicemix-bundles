\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    The goal of the JAXB project is to develop and evolve the code base for the Reference of JAXB, the Java Architecture
    for XML Binding. The JAXB specification is developed through the Java Community Process following the process
    described at jcp.org. This process involves an Expert Group with a lead that is responsible for delivering the
    specification, a reference implementation (RI) and a Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK). The primary goal of an RI
    is to support the development of the specification and to validate it. Specific RIs can have additional goals;
    the JAXB RI is a production-quality implementation that is used directly in a number of products by Oracle and
    other vendors.

    The JAXB expert group has wide industry participation with Oracle as the EG lead. The initial specification
    (JAXB 1.0) was JSR-31 and was released in March 2003.

    The next versions of the spec (JAXB 2.0/2.1/2.2/2.3) are being developed as JSR-222; this release addresses a number
    of additional requirements in the area, and increases the synergy between the JAXB and JAX-WS specifications.

    The supported standards are:
        * JAXB 2.0/2.1/2.2/2.3
        * W3C XML Schema
        * XML DTD
