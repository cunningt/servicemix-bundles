    Apache XML Graphics Commons is a library that consists of several reusable components used by Apache Batik and
    Apache FOP. Many of these components can easily be used separately outside the domains of SVG and XSL-FO.
    You will find components such as a PDF library, an RTF library, Graphics2D implementations that let you generate
    PDF & PostScript files, and much more.
