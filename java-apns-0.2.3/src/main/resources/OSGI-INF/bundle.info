    java-apns is a Java client for Apple Push Notification service (APNs). The library aims to provide a highly
    scalable interface to the Apple server, while still being simple and modular.

    The interface aims to require very minimal code to achieve the most common cases, but have it be reconfigurable
    so you can even use your own networking connections or JSON library if necessary.

    The features are:
        * Easy to use, high performance APNS service API
        * Supports Apple Feedback service
        * Support Enhanced Apple Push Notification
        * Easy to use with Apple certificates
        * Easy to extend and reuse
        * Easy to integrate with dependency injection frameworks
        * Easy to setup custom notification payloads
        * Supports connection pooling
