\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    This library provides UTF-7 and Modified UTF-7 Charsets for Java. Sun's default Java distribution lacks support
    for the UTF-7 character set. Though it is not used commonly, it is still sometimes encountered in e-mails, or
    applications handling e-mail. The package is written as java.nio.charset extension, which means it can be used
    without special installation or configuration. Just drop the jar in your classpath, and you are ready to go.
