\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    Janino is a super-small, super-fast Java™ compiler. Not only can it compile a set of source files to a set of class
    files like JAVAC, but also can it compile a Java™ expression, block, class body or source file in memory, load the
    bytecode and execute it directly in the same JVM.

    JANINO is integrated with Apache Commons JCI ("Java Compiler Interface") and JBoss Rules / Drools.

    JANINO can also be used for static code analysis or code manipulation.

    JANINO can be configured to use javax.tools.JavaCompiler (available since JDK 1.6), i.e. JAVAC, which removes the
    Java 5-related limitations.
