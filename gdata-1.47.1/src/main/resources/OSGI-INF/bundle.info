    The Google Data Protocol is a REST-inspired technology for reading, writing, and modifying information on the web.

    Many services at Google provide external access to data and functionality through APIs that utilize the Google
    Data Protocol. The protocol currently supports two primary modes of access:

        * AtomPub: Information is sent as a collection of Atom items, using the standard Atom syndication format
          to represent data and HTTP to handle communication. The Google Data Protocol extends AtomPub for processing
          queries, authentication, and batch requests.
        * JSON: Information is sent as JSON objects that mirror the Atom representation.
