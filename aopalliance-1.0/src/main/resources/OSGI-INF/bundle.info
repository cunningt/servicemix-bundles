    The AOP Alliance project is a joint open-source project between software engineering people who are
    interested in AOP and Java.

    Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) offers a better solution to many problems than do existing technologies
    such as EJB. AOP Alliance intends to facilitate and standardize the use of AOP to enhance existing
    middleware environment (such as JEE), or development environments (e.g. Eclipse). The AOP Alliance also
    aims to ensure interoperability between Java/JEE AOP implementations.
