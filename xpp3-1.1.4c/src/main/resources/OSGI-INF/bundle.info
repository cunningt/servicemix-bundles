    MXP1: Xml Pull Parser 3rd Edition (XPP3)

    MXP1 is a stable XmlPull parsing engine that is based on ideas from XPP and in particular XPP2 but completely
    revised and rewritten to take the best advantage of latest JIT JVMs such as Hotspot in JDK 1.4+.

    MXP1 was designed to use best available the latest and the most advanced JIT engines such as Hotspot in JDK1.4.
    If you are working on older JDK then previous engine may work faster (both MXP1 and old engine are included in
    XPP3 download).

    MXP1 has following features:

        * fast - let me say it again it is fast :-)
        * small - lot of performance packed in JAR file that is less than 20KB!
        * easy to use - the parser implements common XML pull parsing API (XMLPULL) described at http://www.xmlpull.org

    Performance tests that compare MXP1 to other leading XML parsers are available at
    http://www.extreme.indiana.edu/~aslom/xpp_sax2bench/

    Looking on test results (at http://www.extreme.indiana.edu/~aslom/xpp_sax2bench/results.html) in all but two tests
    MXP1 is the fastest parser by about 5-20% than second fastest Piccolo - MXP1 is slower than Piccolo for 'Mostly text'
    and  'Random XML' as MXP1 will report text always combined as one event. that means that in application there is
    really no need to use StringBuffer to collect element content. i have kept string buffer in all tests for symmetry
    but removing it will speed up test to the same level as Piccolo for example doing this for test setup
    "data\rand_100.xml 2000 ns_on" (Random XML 100) resulted in speedup from 4.3ms to 3.9ms.
