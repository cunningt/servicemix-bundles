\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    XMLPULL is a new streaming API that can read arbitrarily large documents
    like SAX. However, as the name indicates, it is based on a pull model rather
    than a push model. In XMLPULL the client is in control rather than the parser.
    The application tells the parser when it wants to receive the next data chunk
    rather than the parser telling the client when the next chunk of data is available.

    Like SAX, XMLPULL is an open source, parser independent pure Java API based on
    interfaces that can be implemented by multiple parsers.
