    Jets3t is an open source Java toolkit for Amazon S3, Amazon CloudFront, and Google Storage Service.

    The JetS3t toolkit provides Java programmers with a powerful yet simple API for interacting with storage services
    to manage the data you store and distribute through them.

    Some of the key features of the toolkit include:

     * Free! With open-source licensing
     * Easy to use
     * Services handle all the tedious "plumbing", error retries etc. so you don't have to
     * Includes support for multi-threaded uploads/downloads with callbacks for monitoring progress
     * Used as the basis of all the applications in the JetS3t suite, so it has been written with application development in mind
     * Extensible service interface.
