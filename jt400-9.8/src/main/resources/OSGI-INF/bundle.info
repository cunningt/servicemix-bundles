\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    The IBM Toolbox for Java is a library of Java classes supporting the client/server and internet programming models
    to a system running IBM i (or i5/OS or OS/400). The classes can be used by Java applets, servlets, and applications
    to easily access IBM i data and resources.

    The Toolbox does not require additional client support over and above what is provided by the Java Virtual Machine
    and TCP/IP.

    JTOpen is the open source version of the IBM Toolbox for Java licensed program product, and contains the identical
    code. Both have been tested on a wide variety of platforms, including AIX, IBM i, Linux, Solaris, and Windows.

    Details of all the functions and capabilities are available on the IBM Toolbox for Java web page.
