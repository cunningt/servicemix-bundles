\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    Netty is a NIO client server framework which enables quick and easy development of network applications such as
    protocol servers and clients. It greatly simplifies and streamlines network programming such as TCP and UDP
    socket server.

    'Quick and easy' doesn't mean that a resulting application will suffer from a maintainability or a performance
    issue. Netty has been designed carefully with the experiences earned from the implementation of a lot of protocols
    such as FTP, SMTP, HTTP, and various binary and text-based legacy protocols. As a result, Netty has succeeded to
    find a way to achieve ease of development, performance, stability, and flexibility without a compromise.
