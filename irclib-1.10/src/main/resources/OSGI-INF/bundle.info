\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    IRClib is a free Java implementation of the IRC protocol. It requires J2SE 1.2 or later. (Under J2SE 1.2 and 1.3,
    Sun's JSSE is needed to enable SSL support. JSSE is not needed since J2SE 1.4 anymore.)
    IRClib is free software; it's triple-licensed under the GNU LGPL, Apache License 2.0 and Eclipse Public License.
    It's RFC1459 and RFC2812 compliant.
    The core IRClib (org.schwering.irc.lib) is a thin library. There's also a more high-level implementation on-top of
    the core IRClib (org.schwering.irc.manager). The latter is under development at the moment and only available at
    the SVN repository.
