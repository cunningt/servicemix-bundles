\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    Jira REST Java Client is a Java library (usable from any JVM language) which 
    allows to easily talk to any Jira Server 4.2+ instance using new (and still evolving) 
    REST API.
    JRJC currently provides a thin layer of abstraction on top of REST API and related 
    HTTP(S) communication. It provides a domain object model of JIRA entities on the 
    client side - objects representing issues, priorities, resolutions, statuses, users, etc.
    In the future though JRJC may be extended to handle things like caching (conditional GET,
    metadata) or provide a higher level of abstraction on top of existing REST API - completely 
    shielding the user from the specifics of REST.
    JRJC should be useful for integrating systems using JVM-based languages (like Java) with 
    JIRA and specifically for integrating Atlassian products with themselves.
