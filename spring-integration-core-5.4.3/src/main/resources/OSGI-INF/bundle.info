\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    Extends the Spring programming model to support the well-known Enterprise Integration Patterns. 
    Spring Integration enables lightweight messaging within Spring-based applications and supports integration with external systems 
    via declarative adapters. 
    Those adapters provide a higher-level of abstraction over Spring's support for remoting, messaging, and scheduling. 
    Spring Integration's primary goal is to provide a simple model for building enterprise integration solutions 
    while maintaining the separation of concerns that is essential for producing maintainable, testable code.
