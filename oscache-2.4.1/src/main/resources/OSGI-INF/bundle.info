    OSCache is a caching solution that includes a JSP tag library and set of classes to perform fine grained dynamic
    caching of JSP content, servlet responses or arbitrary objects. It provides both in memory and persistent on disk
    caches, and can allow your site to have graceful error tolerance (eg if an error occurs like your db goes down, you
    can serve the cached content so people can still surf the site almost without knowing).
