\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    HOWL is a logger implementation providing features required by the ObjectWeb JOTM project, with a public API that
    is generally usable by any Transaction Manager. HOWL uses unformatted binary logs to maximize performance and
    specifies a journalization API with methods necessary to support JOTM recovery operations.

    HOWL is intended to be used for logging of temporary data such as XA transaction events. HOWL is not a replacement
    for traditional log kits such as LOG4J and Java SE Logging.
